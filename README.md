This is a condensed and math-focused version for the paper's modeling.

## Section 3: The Model

### Asset Payoffs

The firm invests in tangible ($K_t$) and intangible assets ($\tilde{I}_t$). The terminal liquidating value $\widetilde{T}_t$ is realized at $t=t$:
$$
    \widetilde{T}_t = K_t + \tilde{I}_t \tag{1}
$$
